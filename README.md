This is a project from the bootcamp at CodeFactory Vienna.
The task was to create a responsive food blog website with some special requirements. A photo for the design of the landing page was given as guidance.
A couple of images with overlays should be displayed. A "recipe of the month" page should be created just like an "about" page. 
The contact-us link in the footer must be linked to CodeFactory. For the responsiveness a mobile breakpoint was predefined.
Usage of plain HTML and SASS/SCSS was required.
